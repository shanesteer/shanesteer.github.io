        <h4>WHAT IS THE PROJECT?</h4>

        <p>
            Borsalino's Revenge is a pirate-themed Android Game developed in Unreal Engine.
            Borsalino was just a child when his parents were accused of piracy because they
            could not afford to pay the taxes set by the evil Governor Robert. Borsalino watches
            as his parents hang to death before his very eyes. Filled with anger and rage, he 
            vowed to get his revenge on the evil Governor Robert no matter how long he had to
            wait to get it. Borsalino begins his journey as a pirate many years later and looks 
            for information on Governor Roberts whereabouts while killing his goons along the way.

        <p>This game features a stealth kill/ assassination take down system. 
           There are multiple enemies in each map and it may be hard to take on
           many at a time. Perhaps it would be better to pick them off one at a
           time to increase your chances of survival and completing the mission.

    <div class="rectangleimage">

        <p>The player can also carry out attack combos. The player is able to 
           face off against one or multiple enemies. Stamina is deducted from the
           player whenever the attack combo button is pressed however. If the 
           players stamina runs out, they will not be able to attack until enough
           stamina is recovered.

        <h2>UNREAL ENGINE</h2>

        <p>Borsalino's Revenge was developed using Unreal Engine. I was 
           able to develope the game in a fast and efficient manner using the 
           Visual Scripting element. There were also plugins that aided me in 
           the development of this game such as 
           <a id="Links2" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/mixamo-animation-retargeting">Mixamo Animation Re-targeting</a> 
           to help with animations downloaded from 
           <a id="Links2" href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/">Mixamo.com</a>.  

        </p>

        <h2>VISUAL SCRIPTING</h2>

        <p>The Visual Scripting element of Unreal Engine 4 is useful for efficient 
            development and also has alot of support to help new developers.     
        </p>
 
         <p>As a passionate developer, I aspire to develope games with optimized code 
            that allows the program to run as smoothly as possible. The images below 
            show how I utilise functions to prevent repetition of code. 
        </p>

        <div class="Image">
            <img src="./Assets/AttackCode1.png" width="80%">
            <img src="./Assets/AttackCode2.png" width="80%">
        </div>  

        <p>When the attack button is pressed it first runs the turn to closest enemy 
           function created (something like an aimbot to assist players as it is hard 
           to swipe on the screen to look around and attack at the same time). The Custom 
           Event Attack checks to see if the player has stamina to use or not. An Attack 
           Counter is used to increment Combo Attacks if the player is not hit while 
           carrying them out.
        </p>

        <p>Utilising Custom Events and functions like the example above helped me remove 
           redundant and repetitive code allowing efficient development. 
        </p>

        <h2>MIXAMO</h2>

        <p>Mixamo is a website by Adobe which I used to download animation for Borsalino's 
           Revenge. It allows users to download animations that are auto targetted to a 
           user uploaded model(FBX). 
        </p>
        
        <div class="Image">
            <img src="./Assets/Mixamo1.png" width="80%">
            <img src="./Assets/Mixamo2.png" width="80%">
        </div> 

        <p>The models I used were obtained from <a id="Links2" href="https://syntystore.com/collections/frontpage/products/polygon-pirate-pack">Synty Studios</a>. 
           The models from Synty Studio have unique skeleton bone rigging that are not 
           compatible with the Mixamo auto targetting function. This however was overcome 
           by using the plugin I mentioned earlier called "Mixamo Animation Re-targeting". 
           This plugin helped to re-target the downloaded animations to my models automatically.
