        <h4>WHAT IS THE PROJECT?</h4>

        <p>Neighbourhood Watch is an isometric top down shooter. Clara is a retired 
           Marine. One night while sitting on her poarch she sees a meteor fall from the 
           sky and crash in the woods near her neighbourhood. Clara goes into the 
           woods to investigate the meteor when all of a sudden she sees robots with 
           guns emerging from the crashed meteor. Alien robots have landed on Earth 
           and want to take over the world. Realising this, Clara takes it upon herself 
           to protect her neighbourhood from these alien robots using her Marine 
           training. Will Clara be able to defend her neigbourhood and become the 
           Neighbourhood Watch?

        <h4>MULTI-DIRECTIONAL SHOOTING</h4>
    </div>
    

    <div class="rectangleimage">

        <img src="./Assets/MultiShooting.gif" width="50%">

        <p>This game has multi-directional shooting implemented in it. The player 
           is able to shoot their gun in the direction that their mouse pointer is 
           facing on the screen. This makes it easier for the player when they are 
           being engaged by multiple enemies from multiple directions. 
        </p>

    <!-- Power-Ups GIF -->
    <div class="rectangletitle1">
        <h4>POWER-UPS</h4>
    </div>
    

    <div class="rectangleimage">

        <p>There are 2 main power-ups in this game. The first power-up is a health pickup.
           When a player is shot by an enemy, they lose health. They are able to 
           regan health by looking for the green health pickups. The second power-up 
           is shooting speed increase. The bullets fired by the player initially move 
           slowly. This makes it harder for the player to kill the enemies unless they are 
           quite close to them. The blue speed shooting power up allows player to 
           attack from a further distance and minimise damage taken.

    <div class="rectangleparagraph">
        <h4>LEVELS AND TUTORIAL</h4>

        <h2>TUTORIAL</h2>

        <div class="Image">
            <img src="./Assets/NeighbourhoodTutorial1.png" width="80%">
        </div>    

        <p>
            The tutorial of this game is relatively straightforward. There is text 
            with instructions on how to play the game located on the floor. The player 
            just needs to follow the instructions properly on order to advance through 
            the tutorial without problems.
        </p>

        <h2>LEVEL 1</h2>

        <div class="Image">
            <img src="./Assets/NeighbourhoodLvl1.png" width="80%">
        </div> 

        <p>
            The first level has somewhat dark lighting because I wanted it to look 
            like it was early in the morning following the storyline I created. There 
            a few enemies spread out on the map and the player has to kill them all 
            before advancing to the next level.
        </p>

        <h2>LEVEL 2</h2>

        <div class="Image">
            <img src="./Assets/NeighbourhoodLvl2.png" width="80%">
        </div> 

        <p>
            The second level has somewhat brighter lighting as it is supposed to be 
            a continuation from the first level. There are many enemies spread out on 
            the map and the player has to kill them all before completing the game.
        </p>

        <h2>DIFFICULTIES</h2>

        <div class="Image">
            <img src="./Assets/Difficulty.gif" width="80%">
        </div> 

        <p>
            Each level has 2 difficulties that the player can choose from before starting 
            the level. The enemies in the hard difficulty are harder to kill because 
            they have more health compared to the enemies in the easy difficulty.
        </p>
